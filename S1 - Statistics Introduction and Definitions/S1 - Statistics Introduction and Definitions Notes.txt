#Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with collection,analysis, interpretation,presentation and organization of data.
#Statistics converts data into information based on which you can take decision
#Statistics got 2 broad branches
	#Descriptive Statistics
		-Suppose we have dataset of USA states, population,area and literacy rates.
		-Now finding the average population of states or average of area would be descriptive statistics because that is which is summarizing data
		-Dataset : State.X77
		
	
	
	#Inferential Statistics :
		- based on random samples from population make inference about the population.
		- Population and Sample : Population is the big thing and sample is a small piece taken out of population
		- Population : All the people of a country
		- Sample : Taking out some random people and find out some relevant thing among those people
		- So rather than calculation average height of people by selecting all the people of county, you select a good sample of 100-200 people, calculate avg height using their height and get an estimate of avg height in that particular country
		- Dataset ChickenWt : Effect of feed on chicken weight based on samples
