15. Section Introduction - Descriptive Statistics
# Measurement of central tendency
	- Mean
	- Mode
	- Median
	- Percentile
	
# Measurement of variation:
	- Range of data
	- Standard Deviation
	- Variance
	- Interquartile Range
	
# Array


16. Descriptive Statistics (Theory)

#Two types of statistics
	- Descriptive Statistics : find the height,weight, age of all the school kids in the scool (Whole population is included)
	- Inferential Statistics : Take a limited set of students and find their height, weights(a sample is taken out of the population and then we infer and conclude the avg height of students)

#two types of descriptive statistics
	- Central Tendency (Suppose a lady gets lots of calls, so whats the avg time for her to pick up calls once the phone starts ringing)
		- mean
		- median
		- mode
		- percentile
		
	- Variability (The calls length of the lady might differ , so we could see the calls got ranges of various duration)
		- range
		- standard deviation
		- interquartile range

17. Descriptive Statistics - Central Tendency (Theory)
	- Mean of 
		- Population :  µ = ΣX / N
		- Sample : x̄ = Σx/n
		- Mean is affected by extreme values(1 + 2 + 3 + 199 + 5)/5 -> here 199 will affect the mean and make it extremely biased
		
	- Median 
		- To calculate median, you need to order ur data either by ascending or descending 
		- Example : 6,9,10,11,14 so the median = 10
		- Example : 6,9,10,11,11,14 so the median is (10+11)/2 = 10.5
		- Median doesn't get affected by extreme positive or extreme negative values unlike mean
			- For example : 6,9,10,11,11,14990 so the median is (10+11)/2 = 10.5 (we could see the median is still 10.5)
		
	- Mode
		- Most occuring item
		- Example : 10,11,14,9,6,10 (So here mode is 10)
		- Example : 1,2,5,2,1,6 (So here mode is 1 and 2 which is also called bi-modal as it got 2 modes)
		
	- Percentile
		-divides the data into 100 parts (1 - 99)
		
	-Quartile
		-divides the data into 4 parts (Q1 = 25% cut mark)(Q2 = 50% cut mark)(Q3 = 75% cut mark)
		- For Example :  6,9,10,11,14
			- so 10 is the median so it becomes Q2:50%
			- as 9 is in between 6 and 10 so 9 becomes Q1:25%
			- as 11 is between 10 and 14 so 11 becomes Q3 = 75%
		
		- For Example :  6,9,10,11,11,14
			- So Q2:50% would be the median which is (10+11)/2 = 10.5
			- And 9 is between 6 and 10.5 so Q1:25% would be 9
			- And Q3:75% would be (10.5+14)/2 = 12.25
			- 
		
#Percentile / Quartile Steps
	- Arrange in asc/desc order
	- Calculate location(i) = P.(n)/100
	- P=percentile | n=numbers in data set
	- If i is a whole number - Percentile is average of (i)th and (i+1)th location
	- Example: 6,9,10,11,11,14
		STEPS for calculating 1st quartile:
			- i= P.(n)/100 -> (25*6)/100 -> 1.5
			- as i is not a whole number, so we have to take (i+1) = 2.5 and its whole number is 2 
			So, P25(25 percentile) is in 2nd location which is 9
	- Q1=9, Q2=10.5, Q3=11
