24. Three commonly used charts

#When it comes to statistics, there are three important charts or plots which will help you in consolidating your data and present it in a compiled form:
	- Box and Whisker Plot
	- Scatter Diagram



25. Histogram

#Histograms are often used to display the distribution of data.

#Values are assigned bins" and frequency for each bin is plotted

#generally to find out the number of beans, we take sqrt(n) where n is number of elements present

#By using a histogram, you can see accurate data trends, compare groups of data, and identify outliers. These features can help in identifying and quantifying quality issues in a process.

What is a Histogram Used for?
Histograms are useful for detecting patterns and trends in data. They also provide insight into the nature of the data. In general, they are good tools for:

• Finding the central tendency of a set of data.

• Spotting outliers.

• Determining whether the data is normally distributed or skewed.

• Finding unusual events.

• Analyzing the variance of a set of data points.

• Detecting anomalies.

• Visualizing large datasets.



26. Create Histogram

#Refer student_height.xlsx sheet for Histogram demostration
	- the histogram plot shows data is symettric(bell shaped and unimodel)
	
#Unimodel : plot with only one peak



27. Histogram Shapes

#Bimodel : Histogram with two peaks(2 modes)
#Multimodel :  Histogram with multiple peaks(multiple modes)
#Combed Shape: Histogram with gaps(bins frequency=0) in between the bars
	-Usually means someone is not keeping proper records of the data which crated combed shape

28. Box and Whisker Chart
#Also known as Box Plots
#Shows the median --- Q2 
#Show Q1,Q3 and IQR

				----Q1----Q2----Q3----
					_____________	
					|	  |		|<-Box plot

					|_____|_____|

					The center line is Median
			#These side lines are called whiskers	
			
#A different kind of Box and Whisker Plot

<---IQR * 1.5--><--IQR--><---IQR * 1.5---><-Outlier->
	            _________
|---------------|_______|---------------------------|

#Whiskers are limited upto 1.5*IQR and any data that lies beyond this point is Outlier

30. Scatter Diagram

#It plots two sets of observations against each other; the horizontal axis represents one set of observations (independent variable) while the vertical axis represents the second set of observations (dependent variable).

#Scatter diagrams allow you to examine relationships between variables visually. Both of these variables should be continuous variables.


When to Use Scatter Diagram?
You can use a Scatter Diagram (or Scatter Plot, Scatter Chart, Scatter Graph) when you have data in the form of pair, and you want to check the degree of relationship between them.

For example, you have a dataset for 50 students in the class, including the number of hours studied and marks obtained in the exam. Using this dataset, you can evaluate the relationship between these two variables (number of hours studied and marks obtained). In addition, you can find the direction (positive, negative, or no relationship) and the degree of relationship (correlation coefficient between +1 and -1) as well.

#Correlation Coefficient
-A correlation coefficient measures how closely related two variables are. The higher the value, the stronger the positive correlation between the variables. The value of the correlation coefficient varies from +1 to -1.

-Positive correlation: When two variables increase together. In the ideal case, the correlation coefficient value will be +1.

-Negative correlation: When two variables decrease together. In the ideal case, the correlation coefficient value will be -1.

-No correlation: When there is no relationship between two variables. In the ideal case, the correlation coefficient value will be 0.

#What Are the Good Features of a Scatter Diagram?
Quality practitioners use a Scatter diagram to understand the relationship between two variables. It allows them to see how one variable (independent) affects the other variable (dependent). The following features make a Scatter Diagram an excellent visualization tool.

1. Has an Attractive Graphic Appearance

The Scatter Diagram has a very attractive graphic appearance, making it easy to understand the data being represented.

2. Can Be Used With Any Number of Variables
You can use any number of independent and dependent variables to create a scatter plot. For instance, you can add more than two variables to your scatter plot. This makes it possible to compare many different relationships between variables. For more than two variables, you can use different colours for the points or different sizes of the point (Bubble Plot).

3. Provides Visual Support for Analysis

Scatter plots provide visual support for the analysis of the data. After creating a Scatter Plot, you can perform statistical tests such as correlation, regression, and clustering. These analyses can help you better understand the relationships between the variables.

4. Easy to Interpret

If you look at the scatter plot, you can immediately get an idea about the relationship between the variables. There is no need to do complicated calculations and statistical analysis. All you need is eye-balling the scatter plot.


Correlation is not Causation.
It is crucial to remember that even though two variables may seem correlated, this does not necessarily mean they have a cause-and-effect relationship.




31. Create Scatter

	-Plot Scatter Plot in Excel
	-Click in chart elements 
		- check the trendline option - use dropdown and click on linear forecast to see the forcasting
		-Go to more options in trendline - Click Display Equation in chart
			- The Equation can be used for prediction where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable(prediction)
		-Go to more options in trendline - Click R-square value in chart
			- R-square value tell how much % of values could be predicted using the independent variable/s
